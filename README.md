## Descprition
This software incorporates various components such as files, databases, and advanced technologies to establish a comprehensive tech blog. Visitors can browse through the blogs displayed on the homepage and click to view the associated comments. Both the blog posts and comments are displayed with the author's name.

If a user desires to publish their own blog, they can sign up to create an account or log into an existing one. Upon successful login, the user will have access to the dashboard, which provides them with the ability to create and publish their blog posts. Additionally, they can comment on other user's blogs, leaving behind their name and the date of the comment.

The user can choose to logout when they are finished, ending their session. Additionally, the session automatically times out for security reasons.
